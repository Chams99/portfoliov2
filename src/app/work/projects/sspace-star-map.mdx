## Overview

An interactive star map application integrating Stellarium Web Engine with NASA/JPL astronomical data. Features real-time celestial visualization, star search functionality, and personal star collection management.

## Key Features

- Interactive star map with Stellarium Web Engine
- Star search by registration codes
- Personal star naming and collection system
- LocalStorage-based data persistence
- Smooth zoom and navigation controls
- Real-time celestial object rendering
- NASA/JPL astronomical dataset integration

## Technical Implementation

### Astronomy Engine
- **Stellarium Web Engine**: Professional astronomical visualization
- **NASA/JPL Data**: Official astronomical datasets
- **JavaScript**: API integration and data processing
- **LocalStorage**: Personal star collection persistence

### Interactive Features
- Real-time star map rendering
- Search functionality for specific stars
- Custom star naming system
- Smooth camera controls and navigation
- Performance optimization for large datasets

### Data Management
- LocalStorage for personal star collections
- Search indexing for quick star lookup
- Data synchronization and caching
- Offline functionality for saved collections

## Development Challenges

- **Engine Integration**: Successfully integrating complex Stellarium Web Engine API
- **Performance**: Optimizing rendering for thousands of celestial objects
- **Data Management**: Implementing robust LocalStorage system for personal collections
- **User Experience**: Creating intuitive navigation for complex astronomical data

This project demonstrates the power of modern web technologies in making astronomy accessible and interactive. Users can explore the cosmos from their browser, learn about different celestial objects, and create their own meaningful connections with the stars.
