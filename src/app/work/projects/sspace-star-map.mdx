## Overview

Sspace is an innovative web application that brings the wonders of astronomy to your browser. By integrating Stellarium Web Engine with NASA/JPL astronomical datasets, users can explore an interactive star map, search for specific stars, and even create their own personalized star collection.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Star Map**: Powered by Stellarium Web Engine for accurate celestial visualization
- **Star Search by Registration Codes**: Find specific stars using their official registration codes
- **Custom "My Stars" System**: Personal star naming and collection feature
- **LocalStorage-based Saving**: Private, per-device star name storage
- **Cinematic Zoom and Navigation**: Smooth, immersive controls for exploring the night sky
- **Real-time Sky Rendering**: Dynamic visualization of celestial objects
- **NASA/JPL Data Integration**: Access to professional astronomical datasets
- **Private Per-Device Star Names**: Your personal star names stay on your device

## Technical Stack

- **Core Technology**: JavaScript
- **Astronomy Engine**: Stellarium Web Engine
- **Data Source**: NASA/JPL Astronomical Datasets
- **Storage**: LocalStorage API
- **UI/UX**: Custom interactive controls

## Technical Challenges

### Challenge 1: Integration with Stellarium
**Solution**: Successfully integrated the complex Stellarium Web Engine API to provide accurate astronomical visualization while maintaining performance.

### Challenge 2: Real-Time Rendering
**Solution**: Optimized rendering pipeline to ensure smooth, lag-free exploration even when displaying thousands of celestial objects.

### Challenge 3: Custom Star Naming
**Solution**: Implemented a robust LocalStorage system that allows users to create and maintain their personal star collection without requiring backend infrastructure.

## Impact

This project demonstrates the power of modern web technologies in making astronomy accessible and interactive. Users can explore the cosmos from their browser, learn about different celestial objects, and create their own meaningful connections with the stars.
